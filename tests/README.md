# Discord Notify - Testing Guide

This document explains how to run tests for the Discord Notify package.

## Test Types

### 1. Basic Functionality Tests (`npm test`)
Quick tests that verify the package structure and basic functionality without making actual Discord API calls.

```bash
npm test
```

**What it tests:**
- Factory creation
- Configuration options
- Interface structure
- Extend functionality
- Error handling

### 2. Unit Tests (`npm run test:unit`)
Comprehensive unit tests that verify all methods and edge cases.

```bash
npm run test:unit
```

**What it tests:**
- All public methods
- Type safety
- Configuration validation
- Error scenarios

### 3. Integration Tests (`npm run test:integration`)
Real Discord webhook tests that require a valid webhook URL.

```bash
# Set your Discord webhook URL
export DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL="https://discord.com/api/webhooks/YOUR_WEBHOOK_URL"

# Run integration tests
npm run test:integration
```

**What it tests:**
- Actual Discord webhook calls
- Rich embed functionality
- File attachments
- Thread support
- Custom username/avatar
- Error handling with real API

### 4. E2E Installation Tests (`npm run test:e2e`)
Comprehensive end-to-end tests that create temporary projects, install the package from NPM, and test real functionality.

```bash
npm run test:e2e
```

**What it tests:**
- Package installation from NPM registry
- CommonJS project compatibility
- TypeScript project compatibility
- ES Modules compatibility
- Yarn package manager support
- Node.js version compatibility
- Production environment testing
- Package.json dependencies validation

### 5. All Tests (`npm run test:all`)
Runs both basic and unit tests.

```bash
npm run test:all
```

### 6. Full Test Suite (`npm run test:full`)
Runs all tests including E2E installation tests.

```bash
npm run test:full
```

## Setting Up Integration Tests

### 1. Create a Discord Webhook

1. Go to your Discord server settings
2. Navigate to Integrations > Webhooks
3. Click "New Webhook"
4. Choose a test channel
5. Copy the webhook URL

### 2. Set Environment Variable

```bash
# Unix/Linux/macOS
export DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL="https://discord.com/api/webhooks/YOUR_WEBHOOK_URL"

# Windows (Command Prompt)
set DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL=https://discord.com/api/webhooks/YOUR_WEBHOOK_URL

# Windows (PowerShell)
$env:DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL="https://discord.com/api/webhooks/YOUR_WEBHOOK_URL"
```

### 3. Run Integration Tests

```bash
npm run test:integration
```

```

### Integration Tests
```
üîó Running Discord Notify Integration Tests...

‚ö†Ô∏è  Note: These tests require a valid Discord webhook URL
   Set DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL environment variable to run integration tests

‚úÖ should send a simple message to Discord
‚úÖ should send a success message to Discord
‚úÖ should send an error message to Discord
‚úÖ should send an alert message to Discord
‚úÖ should send an info message to Discord
‚úÖ should send a rich embed message to Discord
‚úÖ should send multiple embeds using extend
‚úÖ should send message with custom username and avatar
‚úÖ should send message with content outside embed
‚úÖ should handle invalid webhook URL gracefully
‚úÖ should handle empty webhook URL gracefully
‚úÖ should handle rapid message sending

üìä Integration Test Results: 12 passed, 0 failed
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Cannot find module" errors**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **TypeScript compilation errors**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

3. **Integration tests failing**
   - Verify your webhook URL is correct
   - Check that the webhook has proper permissions
   - Ensure the Discord server is accessible

4. **Rate limiting**
   - Discord has rate limits on webhooks
   - Integration tests may fail if too many requests are made
   - Wait a few minutes and try again

### Debug Mode

To see detailed test output, you can modify the test files to include more logging:

```typescript
// Add this to any test file for detailed logging
console.log('Debug info:', { webhookUrl, config, result });
```

## Continuous Integration

For CI/CD pipelines, you can run tests without integration tests:

```yaml
# Example GitHub Actions workflow
- name: Run Tests
  run: |
    npm install
    npm run test:all
    npm run build
```

Integration tests should be run separately with proper webhook URLs configured.
